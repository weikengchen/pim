# Pim! - Pin Improvement Mod

A Fabric mod designed to enhance the pin collection and trading experience with visual aids and quality-of-life features for pin traders and collectors.

## Setup

After installation, the user needs to open all pages in /pinrarity and /pinbook to load the current pin series data. The user may need to open some pin series (blinking) to load the specific pins in the series to the mod.

## Highlights

### Pin trading board

Pins that are not relevant to the user are displayed with a magenta color. Pins that the user should exchange are highlighted with a green background. 

### Inventory

Mint pins in the inventory that can be put into /pinbook are shown with a green background. Mint pins that the player already has the mint copies in /pinbook are shown with a golden background (signaling that they can still be used for pin trading). 

### Pinbook series

Pin series with missing information would be blinking. Otherwise, yellow background signals that the pin series are not complete, and green background signals that some pins in the inventory can be put into this series.

### Pin pack

Pins in the pin pack that are not relevant are shown with a magenta color. Mint pins that can be put into the pinbook has a green highlight, and mint pins that the player already has the mint copies in /pinbook are shown with a golden background.
